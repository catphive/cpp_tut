A C++ Tutorial
==============

This tutorial is meant to be an introduction to C++, with a focus on how to use
the standard library. Through the use of the standard library, I want to build
up an intuition of how good c++ objects and functions behave.

The details object oriented design will, for the most part, not be covered.
Similarly, I will not cover template programming in depth. Hopefully, I will
have an opportunity to give another tutorial in the future that will cover these.

Topics
------
1. Basic input and output using `iostreams`.
2. Overview of STL concepts (collections, iterators, algorithms)
3. `std::vector`
4. `std::string` (`std::string` vs `std::vector<char>`)
5. Values and References. Pass by reference, return by value.
6. Type inference with `auto`.
7. Basic algorithms (`std::sort`, `std::reverse`, `std::copy`, `std::find`)
8. Using `std::copy` with iterator adapters.
9. Lambas (anonymous nested functions)
10. Higher order algorithms (`std::find_if`, `std::for_each`, `std::transform`,
    `std::accumulate`)
